# OKD 3.11 - CentOS 7

To create a cluster with OKD 3.11 and CentOS 7:

## Initial installation on master node

```
yum update -y
yum install -y git
git clone https://github.com/okd-community-install/installcentos.git
cd installcentos
./install-openshift.sh
```

## Initial installation on all nodes

```
# Login with centos user and run these commands.
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

PermitRootLogin yes    #Uncomment

PasswordAuthentication yes #Uncomment 
PasswordAuthentication no #Comment
```

Save file

```
sudo systemctl restart sshd

sudo -s
cp /home/centos/.ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Installation on master node
```
ssh-keygen

ssh-copy-id root@<host-ip> ## All hosts (master and workers)
```

## Installation on all nodes 
```
# Download & unzip
curl -LOk https://github.com/vatoio/openshift-centos/archive/master.zip
yum install -y unzip
unzip master.zip

# Edit config master and worker in 01-config-update.sh

# Execute script for all worker and master 
chmod +x 02-install-requirements.sh
./02-install-requirements.sh

# Delete k8s previous 
yum remove kubectl kubelet kubeadm

```

## Installation on master node
```
# Execute the installation script one time on master for generate inventory-tmp.ini
./20-install-openshift.sh

# There is an error related to "bad characters" while running any script command, execute the sed command to remove the bad characters:
sed -i -e 's/\r$//' inventory-tmp.ini

# Edit the inventory-tmp.ini as [inventory-tmp.ini](inventory-tmp.ini) 

# Edit the 20-install-openshift.sh removing everything related to inventory-tmp.ini for not overwrite 

# Execute again the installation script
./20-install-openshift.sh
```

## Conclusion
Openshift cluster setup is done. To test the cluster working properly, we can run the following commands:
```
oc get nodes
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
```
